<h1>Learning Python: Building a Hangman Game</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I’m excited to share that I just finished building a Python version of the classic Hangman game! This project challenged me more than any of the previous ones I’ve tackled so far, and it really pushed me to think critically about how to organize my code, handle user input, and keep track of game logic like guessing letters, updating the display, and checking for a win or loss.
<br> </br>
It was more than just writing code. It was about problem-solving, debugging, and making sure the game ran smoothly from start to finish. I even started thinking about how to improve the user experience, like showing the word with dashes, tracking incorrect guesses, and letting players know when the game ends.
<br> </br>
Each project I complete is a steppingstone, and  Hangman showed me just how far I’ve come and how much more there is to learn. As I continue on this Python journey, I’m getting more comfortable with writing real programs and seeing my skills develop one line at a time.
